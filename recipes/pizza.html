      <br />
      <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <br />

      <br />
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <br />
      <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
      <br />
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <br />
      <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
      <br />
      <li>4 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
      <br />
      <li>½ cup salsa</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <br />
      <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <br />
      <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
      <br />
      <li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>
      <br />
      <li>¼ cup thinly sliced jalapeño pepper</li>
      <br />
      <li>¼ cup sour cream (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 2 pie plates
        with non-stick cooking spray.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place ground beef, onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium heat. Cook
        until beef is evenly browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and
        discard grease. Season beef with chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Lay one tortilla in each pie plate, and cover with a layer of refried
        beans. Spread 1/2 of the seasoned ground beef over each one, and then
        cover with a second tortilla. Bake in the preheated oven until tortillas
        are crisp, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Remove pizzas from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Then spread
        1/2 of the salsa over each top tortilla. Cover each pizza with 1/2 of
        the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Place 1/2 of the tomatoes, 1/2 of
        the green onions, and 1/2 of the jalapeño slices onto each one.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Return pizzas to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 to 10
        more minutes. Let pizzas cool slightly before slicing each one into 4
        pieces.
      </li>
    </ol>
