      <li>
        Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground
        beef.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the
        meat to add tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of
        tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance
        the flavor of the sauce.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh
        parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and
        black pepper.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
      <li>
        Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna
        extra decadent
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna
        when you cut into it.
